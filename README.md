# pbx_boxpredictor
This project performs Pourbaix stability analysis on bulk oxides from the Materials Project Database 
and creates models to predict stability regions based on bulk composition and elemental properties.

datafiles: Contains stability data extracted from Materials Project
stabilitymodels: Contains simple linear regression and logistic regression models for 
stability metrics based on composition and elemental properties
automl: Applies TPOT to refine ML models for stability predictions
